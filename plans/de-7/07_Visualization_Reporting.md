# Module 7: Visualization & Data Modeling

## 🎯 Learning Objectives
* **Design** a Star Schema (Fact vs. Dimension tables).
* **Understand** BI Tool connectivity.
* **Build** a dashboard that answers questions, not just shows numbers.

## 1. Data Modeling for BI
You cannot just throw raw data at Tableau/PowerBI. It will be slow and confusing.
* **Star Schema:** The Gold Layer standard.
    * **Fact Table:** The center. Contains numbers (Metrics) and Foreign Keys. (e.g., `Fact_Sales`: `order_id`, `product_id`, `amount`, `qty`).
    * **Dimension Table:** The arms of the star. Contains descriptive text. (e.g., `Dim_Product`: `product_id`, `product_name`, `category`, `color`).
* **Why?** Storing "Red" in the sales table 1 million times is wasteful. Store `color_id` instead.

## 2. Visualization Best Practices
1.  **Context is King:** A number "10,000" means nothing. "10,000 (Up 5% from last week)" means everything.
2.  **Latency:** Make sure the user knows how fresh the data is (e.g., "Data updated: 1 hour ago").

## 🧪 Hands-On Activity: Modeling & Dashboarding
**Goal:** Create a Star Schema View and visualize it.

**Step 1: Create Views in SQL (Postgres)**
Using your data from Module 2/3, create a Fact and Dimension structure.
```sql
-- Example generated by Cursor
CREATE VIEW dim_customer AS SELECT id, name, region FROM customers;
CREATE VIEW fact_orders AS SELECT id, customer_id, amount, order_date FROM orders;
